# Astrophysical Image Processing Using James Webb Space Telescope Obersvations
The aim of this project was to detect and count the number of stars in the [Pillars of Creation](https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2022/nasa-s-webb-takes-star-filled-portrait-of-pillars-of-creation) image captured by the James Webb Space Telescope ([JWST](https://webb.nasa.gov/)) on October 21st, 2022. The methods and algorithms used for this procedure are covered in the documentation of the project.

# How to run
The majority of the code is in the [Notebook](https://github.com/KouroshKSH/Astrophysical-Image-Processing-Using-JWST/tree/main/Notebooks) folder. Once cloned or downloaded, simply run each cell in a sequential manner. Make sure that the `.fits` data sets are in the same directory as the Jupyter notebookes that you wish to run. They are:
1. `carine_nircam.fits` ([link](https://github.com/KouroshKSH/Astrophysical-Image-Processing-Using-JWST/blob/main/Notebooks/carina_nircam.fits))
2. `m16_nircam.fits` ([link](https://github.com/KouroshKSH/Astrophysical-Image-Processing-Using-JWST/blob/main/Notebooks/carina_nircam.fits))
